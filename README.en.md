# CodandoJuntas TwitterBot 

> TwitterBot (created for [CodandoJuntas](https://github.com/CodandoJuntas/entenda) project) is responsible for retweeting the #CodandoJuntas hashtag, to share what the girls that participate on the project are developing. With that, it's easy to find out projects that you have interest to collaborate or find help to your own project.
